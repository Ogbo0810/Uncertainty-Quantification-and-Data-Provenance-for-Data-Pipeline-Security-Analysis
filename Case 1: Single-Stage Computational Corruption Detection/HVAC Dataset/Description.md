## üè¢ About the Dataset

The dataset includes operational data collected from simulations, lab experiments, and real-world building measurements across **seven HVAC system types**:

- Rooftop unit  
- Single-duct air handler unit  
- Dual-duct air handler unit  
- Variable air volume (VAV) box  
- Fan coil unit  
- Chiller plant  
- Boiler plant  

Each dataset contains:

- Multiple `.csv` files with time-series data covering both fault-free and various fault scenarios (at different severity levels)  
- A `.pdf` document summarizing key details and context  
- A `.ttl` file to support data visualization via the BRICK schema

This dataset was developed collaboratively by **LBNL, PNNL, NREL, ORNL, and Drexel University**.
