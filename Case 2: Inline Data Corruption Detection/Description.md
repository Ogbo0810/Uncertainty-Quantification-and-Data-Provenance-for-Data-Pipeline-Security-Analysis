This experiment accounts for scenarios where all pipeline stages are in ideal operating conditions but the ingestion of data is corrupted
as a result of an attacker introducing false readings manually to mimic a non-existent fault in the physical system being monitored.
The tests are done for two separate datasets representing two different types of cyber-physical systems,
- HVAC systems
- Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
